    <h2>CK</h2>
    <p>Hey there, how's it going... Call me CK for short. Am 24 years old and the last eight siblings. Am single from Ghana. I love playing soccer and video games. Listening to music and watching anime is a gem for me. </p>
    <p>I have a thing for softwares and design stuff, so am hoping to make a career out of the things I learn from this community. At present, I work part-time in a bakery.</p>
    <p>Am glad to be a part of BYU Idaho and their amazing program...and am certainly happy to be part of this community, I hope to learn plenty stuff from you all.</p>
    <p>Grazie!</p>
